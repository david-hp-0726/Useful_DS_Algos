// Boyer-Moore-Horspool’s algorithm capitalizes on comparison work we’ve already done to skip alignments 
// that provably won’t result in any match. It makes use of a bad match table, which stores the last occurrence of 
// each character. The table allows us to know how far to jump ahead whenever a mismatch is found.

// Consider the following example
// S: ABBABCABC
// P: ABCABC
// Bad Match Table (C is 3 instead of -1 because we don’t take the last character into account when building BMT):
// A  B  C 
// 2  1  3

// Comparison Starts:
	      v
// ABBABCABC
	      v
// ABCABC

// The algorithm would start the comparison at index 5 working backward. Upon finding a mismatch between ‘B’ and ‘C’, 
// it would reach the following conclusion: 

// “Clearly, the substring “ABBABC” cannot be a match. However, I do know the matching portion of this substring “ABBABC” ends 
// with ‘C’, and ‘C’ also occurs somewhere else in the pattern. Therefore, if I shift the pattern to the right by 3 and compare 
// again, I would get a substring like this “**C***”. Since I cannot not rule out the possibility that this substring is a valid match, 
// I must start my next comparison with this substring.”

// In this case, the algorithm would skip ahead 3 index and “**C***” turns out to be a match.


// The next example would clarify why we won’t consider the last character when building the BMT:
// S: ABBABDABCABD
// P: ABCABD
// Bad Match Table:
// A  B  C   D
// 2  1  3  -1

// Comparison Starts:
	      v
// ABBABDABCABD
	      v
// ABCABD


// The algorithm would start the comparison at index 5 working backward. Upon finding a mismatch 
// between ‘B’ and ‘C’, it would reach the following conclusion: 
// “Clearly, the substring “ABBABD” cannot be a match. However, with the knowledge that the matching 
// portion starts with ‘D’, and’ that D’ does not appear anywhere else in this substring, therefore we 
// can rule out all of the following substrings as possible matches since ‘D’ can only take place at index 5.”
“BBABD*” 
“BABD**”
“ABD***”
“BD****”
“D*****”

// Notice here, without actually examining the 5 substrings we are able to rule them out with the knowledge 
// that ‘D’ does not appear anywhere else in the substring. The same logic would still apply even if we change ‘D’ 
// to other characters absent in the pattern.

// In conclusion, Boyer-Moore enables us to take advantage of mismatches to dispense with useless comparisons. 
// In the ideal scenario where there are no repeating characters in our pattern, Boyer-Moore algorithm can be run in 
// linear time. That said, there is a significant drawback to the algorithm, which is when the pattern involves a lot of 
// repeating characters and the algorithm would not be able to skip redundant comparisons. For instance, the following 
// example would result in the algorithm exhausting every single substring, giving a worst-case time complexity of O(n * m):
String:   AAAAAAB
Pattern: AAAB
